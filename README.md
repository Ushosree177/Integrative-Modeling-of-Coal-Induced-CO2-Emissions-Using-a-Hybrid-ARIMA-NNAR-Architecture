CO₂ Emission Forecasting Using ARIMA–NNAR 

This project analyzes U.S. CO₂ emissions from coal using time-series forecasting.
We apply three models: ARIMA, NNAR, and a Hybrid ARIMA–NNAR approach.
ARIMA captures linear patterns, while NNAR learns nonlinear behavior.
The hybrid model combines both strengths for better forecasting accuracy.
We perform diagnostics like ACF, residual plots, Shapiro-Wilk, and Ljung-Box tests.
Results show ARIMA fits well but misses some nonlinear patterns.
NNAR improves prediction accuracy, capturing complex fluctuations.
The hybrid model gives the best performance, showing a sharper decline in future emissions.
This helps understand long-term environmental trends and supports policy decisions.
The project highlights a powerful method for forecasting real-world environmental data.
